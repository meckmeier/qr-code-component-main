## My process
Reviewed the brief, and then adjusted the HTML to include appropriate tags. 
Adding styles after the fact to control the look of the site.
I used VS GoLive to view the changes as I made them and worked thru each object until I thought it looked OK.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (embedded in the HTML)
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
This project helped me work thru using GitHub to manage my project. I'm still a bit iffy on all the steps, but I think I got them to work.
I'm leveraging more and more the functionality in VS - including Emmet which really helped with a number of these components.


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development
I would like to review the https://www.markdownguide.org. I think there are a number of technologies I want to understand so I can become fluent in this space. I'm working on learning the basic of javascript as well. However, I was sidelined by the role of CSS after following a free course from Kevin Powell and it seems there are still a lot of things to learn about html and css before I revisit the JS component.


### Useful resources

I took the responsive layout course from Kevin Powell and found it powerfully useful. (https://courses.kevinpowell.co/)
